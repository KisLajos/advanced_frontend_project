    What We do
    
    Four hours of open bar - at your private event.
    
    We will bring everything prepared from back home at Gedulgt. 
    
    Homemade syrups, extractions, freshly squeezed juices, fermentations, fruits & vegetables, and the liquor. 
    
    The bartenders will be at the venue 1 to 2 hours before the open bar begins, to set up our bars, with cocktail glasses, ice cubes, cocktail napkins, bar-equipment, straws and the products. 
    
    We look forward to serve Gedulgt cocktails at your event!
